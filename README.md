# Ex.No: 05  IMPLEMENTATION OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS AND DECOMPOSITION
### Date: 22.09.2025

### AIM:
To Illustrates how to perform time series analysis and decomposition on the monthly average temperature of a city/country and for airline passengers.

### ALGORITHM:
1. Import the required packages like pandas and numpy
2. Read the data using the pandas
3. Perform the decomposition process for the required data.
4. Plot the data according to need, either seasonal_decomposition or trend plot.
5. Display the overall results.

### PROGRAM:
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv("/mnt/data/Amazon.csv")

# Convert Date column to datetime
data["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(data["Date"])

# Set Date as index
data.set_index("Date", inplace=True)

# Use Adjusted Close for time series
ts = data["Adj Close"].asfreq("B")  # Business-day frequency

# Perform seasonal decomposition (weekly, monthly, yearly patterns are possible)
decomposition = seasonal_decompose(ts.dropna(), model="multiplicative", period=252)  
# 252 â‰ˆ trading days in a year

# Plot all components
decomposition.plot()
plt.show()



```
